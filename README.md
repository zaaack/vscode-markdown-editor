## Usage

This plugin auto-associates itself with markdown (.md, .markdown) file format. If you have the plugin installed, and open a markdown file - it will automatically use this plugin to edit it.

If you prefer to switch between the VSCode default editor and this plugin, you can do so by:

1. Use `Ctrl+shift+p` (or `Cmd+shift+p` on mac) to bring up the command pallete
2. Search and activate `View: Reopen Editor with...`

VSCode will provide a menu with all available editors for current file format, including Text which is the default editor.

## Caveats

This editor uses a custom webview based editor instead of VSCode's default monaco editor.

So any plugins and customizations that target VSCode's editor (eg. Vim keybindings, LSP autocompletion support etc.) will not be available in markdown editor.
